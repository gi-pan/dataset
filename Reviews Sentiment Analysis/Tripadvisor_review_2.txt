Absolutely pathetic from start to finish I travel a lot for work and have had better service and quality at a Days Inn. Their star rating is a joke. My experience started with a highly impersonal and grouchy check in at the front desk and continued with the following room problems: 1.) Called to request a fan for the room (I always sleep with white noise and always get a fan at hotels). Never arrived. Called again. Never arrived. Next mornning, after getting very little sleep, a man at the front desk gave me his little fan.2.) Called down upon settling into my room because of horrible cigarette smoke coming from somewhere. Confirmed I was on a non-smoking floor, but was told the floor below me is smoking. No apology, no offer to move, nothing. (Actually, they did offer to come and spray my room.)3.) Went to iron my clothes and discovered a scorched ironplate. Called to request a new one and went to dinner. Hours later, upon return, no iron. Called again and it took another hour.4.) Next morning went to make coffee in the room - coffee maker was broken. Called for a new one. They sent up a new pot - not a new maker. Not scoring ANY points by now with me.5.) Took a shower and stood in five inches of water because the drain didn't drain. Also had to do a backbend to get my head under the spray (and I'm 5'7). 6.) TV speakers are blown.7.) Maid didn't check the clock in my room - it was set to PM instead of AM, so I didn't get woken up on time my first morning here. This 5 star hotel does not have it's act together - the quality is horrendous. I will never stay or recommend a Fairmont Hotel. Go somewher else
