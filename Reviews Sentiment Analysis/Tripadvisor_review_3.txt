The rooms on the 3rd floor are fairly small and do not have balconies or views. The room was very clean however, and everything was in working order. The free wired internet was fantastic and much better than the wi-fi you normally find in hotels. The free safe, refrig, microwave, coffee maker, coffee, newspaper, LCD TV,etc. made up for the room. Although the hotel was renovated a few years ago somehow they managed to retain the shabby appearance. The room furnishings were disproportionately large for the size of the room and featured lots of drawers and shelves but not a desk nor writing area and not even a chair! Yes, they have a bowl of apples at the front desk and give you bottles of cold water upon check-in. Most of the staff was extremely nice although the person who checked me in (Ms. Sina) was efficient and professional but lacked the aloha spiriti. All in all, this is a good choice if you're looking for a budget hotel.
