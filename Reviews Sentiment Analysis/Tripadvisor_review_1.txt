Great Service and Big Room Our stay at the Fairmont was almost perfect. The staff were the most courteous and helpful of any hotel at which we've stayed. The concierge gave great recommendations on dining and things to do in the area and check in and out was smooth and easy. The room (a standard room with two queen beds) was much larger than rooms at comparably priced hotels and we really enjoyed a relaxing time.Two reasons prohibit me from giving this hotel 5 stars. (I won't even mention the $21 a night parking. I realize that this is the case pretty much anywhere, but it's highway robbery. At least the valet service was excellent and efficient). First of all - why charge for high speed internet when you're already getting $120 for the room (not counting parking)? That seems a bit greedy and unnecesary. Secondly, they charged me for a local phone call! It only amounted to fifty cents, but still. In a hotel this nice and service oriented you would think that internet and local calls should be included.Overall though - this was a great stay, we fully intend to return, and heartily recommend the Fairmont to anyone.
